# TextAdventure
Text Adventure console game for final assignment in first course of .NET C# programming @Nackademin.

Small flashing lights warning. Play in fullscreen (press F11) for best experience.

The game is very short, the point is more to show off some of the effects in the effect class. (And hopefully to be somewhat entertaining)

Answer "y" or "yes" to first question to play.

Using Jorts will win the game, so if you want to see everything, leave the jorts behind.

You can make your own items/rooms/effects, as long as you keep the logic between them (Since eerything is using item id #s to function) intact. And getting the correct textfile functioning is not very user friendly. I have a half-made creation mode that'll be done at some point. Then anyone can make stuff for their own text adventure with some (imo) cool effects.
